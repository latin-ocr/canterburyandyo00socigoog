NOTE.

ALTHOUGH this part contains the Index and Corrigenda to Vol. 1 of
the Lincoln Registers‚ members are requested Nor ‘ro mvn ruam
PARTS noum) ιιι) until they receive the introduction to the whole oi the
registers of Bishop Hugh de welles, These are now well in hand and
everyheffort will be made to complete the issue in the course of a few
mont ε.
The Rev. H. Salter sends the following note :-—“ After the rolls of
“ Institutions for Oxon, Bucks and N orthants have been printed (tle. rolls
“ 3, 7 and 2), there remain the rolls of Institutions for the Archdeaconries
“ of HuntS„ Beda, Leicester, Stow and Lincoln (rolls 8, 6, 5, 4, ra).
“This leaves three rolIS, Nos. 1, 9 and 14. The first contains an account
- “ot' the Vicarages of the Archdeaconry of Lincoln (not ‘Lincoln and
“'Stow as stated on the inside of the cover ot Part 1). It is parallel
“with the ‘Quinque rotuli consuti’ (No. 11) which has been printed
“at the end of Part 1. Roll 9 is unique. From references in what
“has already been printed it is clear that each archdeaconry had two
“rolls-—a Rotulus Institutionum and a Rotulus Cartarum. All the‘ rolls
“of charters’ are lost, except that for the Archdeaconry of N orthampton
“It contains copies of, letters and charters concerning the archdeaconry,
“such as the charters that were given by the Bishop when he admitted
“anyone to a living, as these charters are dated and have witnesses
‘they will be particularly valuable. There are also copies of Papal
‘,‘letters of letters by patrons when presenting to livings, etc, The rolls
“ of Institutions only give the yearS, but these letters supply the mouth
44 and the day when the candidate was presented.
‘R‘oughly speaking this Rotulus Cartarum corresponds to the division
44 call‘ed Memoranda in the later Registers.
“Roll 14, ‘Diverse matters’‚ proves to be a single membrane, of about
“the time of Edward 111, having, as far as can be seen, no connexion
“with Bishop Hugh or any other bishop. When they were clearing out
“ an old room over one of the gates in Lincoln, they found two or three
“ mitldewed documents. This seems to be one them. Another, Ι think,
“ is in the box which contains the rolls of Oliver Sutton.”

It is intended that in September, Part I—consisting of about 128
pages—os the interesting register of John de Halton, Bishop of Carlisle
1292- 1324, be distributed to members. This, when complete, will
probably extend to upwasds of 600 pages.
